# Voice Design Architecture

## Boundary

Voice Clone is an established feature on `main`. Its MiniMax, CosyVoice, and
MiMo provider clients remain in:

```text
utils/voice_clone.py
```

The established ElevenLabs Clone and preview helper stays in
`main_routers/characters_router/voice_providers.py`, because that router helper
is also used by the saved-voice preview endpoint. It must not host Voice Design
payload construction or response parsing.

Voice Design is the new, structurally dual feature. Its provider clients live in:

```text
utils/voice_design.py
```

Do not add Voice Design payloads, endpoint construction, response parsing, or
validation methods to `utils/voice_clone.py`. Likewise, do not put Voice Clone
provider behavior in `utils/voice_design.py`.

Provider-neutral values shared by both flows, such as MiniMax endpoints and
voice-id sanitation, belong in `utils/tts/providers/`, not either feature util.

## Provider Matrix

| Provider | Voice Clone | Voice Design |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CosyVoice | `QwenVoiceCloneClient` | `_cosyvoice_design_voice` |
| MiniMax CN/Intl | `MinimaxVoiceCloneClient` | `_minimax_design_voice` |
| ElevenLabs | `_elevenlabs_clone_voice` | preview + create helpers |
| MiMo | `MimoVoiceCloneClient` | `MimoVoiceDesignClient` |

The different method shapes reflect upstream API differences:

- CosyVoice and MiniMax return reusable remote voice IDs in one request.
- ElevenLabs requires preview then create; the unified route performs both.
- MiMo has no remote enrollment ID. NEKO stores the description and sends it
  again when synthesizing with the Voice Design model. Its user prefix is
  display metadata only; the local ID is opaque and does not inherit MiniMax
  character or length restrictions.

## Router And Runtime

`main_routers/characters_router/voice_cloning.py` retains only the established
Voice Clone routes. `main_routers/characters_router/voice_design.py` owns the
Voice Design routes and imports all provider-specific Design operations from
`utils.voice_design`.

`main_logic/tts_client/workers/` remains the synthesis layer. A saved designed
voice must use the same character prompt templates and routing contract as a
cloned voice; only provider-required voice input differs.

Provider capabilities and documented hard limits remain declarative in
`utils/tts/provider_registry.py` and the corresponding registrations in
`main_logic/tts_client/__init__.py`.
