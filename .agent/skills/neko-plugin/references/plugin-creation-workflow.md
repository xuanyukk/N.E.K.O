# Plugin Creation Workflow

Use this when creating a new N.E.K.O plugin.

## Minimum Question Set

Ask these before designing a new plugin, unless the conversation already answered them.

1. What should this plugin be called?
2. What is this plugin for?
3. Which package type fits it?
   - Plugin: an independent feature; this is the default for tools, background work, timers, UI, and ordinary external service/device integrations.
   - Extension: adds entries or hooks to an existing plugin; requires a host plugin.
   - Adapter: bridges an external protocol/request stream into N.E.K.O plugin calls.
4. What should the first version include?
   - callable entries, background/lifecycle work, timers, message reaction, UI, storage/settings, cross-plugin calls, external service/device connection, or protocol gateway.
5. If this is an Extension, which host plugin does it attach to?
6. What is out of scope for the first version?

Keep questions in user-facing language. Use the answers to infer plugin architecture; do not ask the user to design individual entries first.

When deriving `plugin_id`, avoid a redundant `_plugin` suffix unless it is part of the real name. The CLI appends `Plugin` to the generated class name.

## Follow-ups

Ask Guidance Follow-ups only when the user's intent is vague and they need help choosing a direction.

Ask Risk Follow-ups when answers imply:

- external protocols or services
- credentials or secrets
- persistence, database, or state ownership
- UI permissions
- background work, auto-start, timers, or shutdown behavior
- extension host behavior
- adapter/gateway behavior
- out-of-bound platform needs

## Design Brief

Before implementation, present a short Plugin Design Brief. After confirmation, create the plugin with the CLI, then save the brief as:

```text
plugin/plugins/<plugin_id>/DESIGN.md
```

Template:

```md
# <Plugin Name> Design Brief

## Identity Lock
- plugin_id:
- folder:
- name:
- entry:
- main class:
- host plugin: <!-- Extension only -->

## Purpose

## Package Type and Capabilities
- package type:
- capabilities:
- inferred architecture:

## First Version Scope

## Out of Scope

## Inferred Technical Needs
- plugin.toml sections:
- SDK surfaces:
- UI surfaces:
- state/config:
- lifecycle/background work:
- external integrations:

## Read Context Plan

## Write Workspace
`plugin/plugins/<plugin_id>/`

## Risk Follow-ups
```

Keep `DESIGN.md` short. Do not use it as a changelog or API reference.

## Standard Scaffold

Create standard plugins through the CLI in the project uv environment. Do not hand-create the initial plugin directory, `plugin.toml`, or entry class.

For a normal plugin:

```bash
uv run neko-plugin init <plugin_id> --type plugin --name "<Plugin Name>" --no-interactive
```

For an adapter:

```bash
uv run neko-plugin init <plugin_id> --type adapter --name "<Plugin Name>" --no-interactive
```

Extension scaffolding needs host plugin details; use the interactive CLI path or ask the required host questions before proceeding:

```bash
uv run neko-plugin init <plugin_id> --type extension --name "<Plugin Name>"
```

The CLI owns the initial tree under `plugin/plugins/<plugin_id>/`. Expect at least `plugin.toml` and the entry module, and normally `__init__.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, `tests/test_smoke.py`, `.gitignore`, and `.vscode/`. Add capability directories such as `ui/`, `static/`, `docs/`, `i18n/`, or `vendor/` only when the plugin actually needs them.

After CLI scaffolding:

1. Read the generated tree, `plugin.toml`, and entry class.
2. Check Identity Lock and Plugin Workspace Tree against the generated files.
3. Write `DESIGN.md` into `plugin/plugins/<plugin_id>/`.
4. Convert or keep runtime-triggered entries as `async def`.
5. Move expensive startup, network calls, and side effects out of module import time and into lifecycle/entry handlers.
6. Modify only inside the generated workspace.

## Implementation Gate

Do not implement until these are clear:

- Identity Lock
- Package Type and Capabilities
- Write Workspace
- First Version Scope
- Out of Scope
- unresolved Risk Follow-ups, if any
- standard scaffold command to run
- async entry plan for callable entries
- no top-level side effects beyond constants, imports, and cheap definitions
