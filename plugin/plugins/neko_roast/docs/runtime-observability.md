# NEKO Live Runtime Observability

This document is the canonical source for NEKO Live runtime observability language. It defines what code, reviews, monitor views, and dashboard surfaces must be able to explain. The plugin ships `tools/monitor_live.ps1` as a read-only evidence helper; it does not replace Dashboard projections, recent results, `live_explain`, or backend logs as runtime sources of truth. Gift / SC / Guard behavior is currently implemented by `live_support_events`.

## Purpose

Runtime observability must answer five questions:

- Did the live event enter NEKO Live?
- Which stage handled it last?
- Why was it selected, skipped, failed, degraded, or pushed?
- Did the dispatcher actually send output, dry-run it, or skip it?
- What can Dashboard show without exposing private data?

## Non-goals

- Do not define a concrete Dashboard layout.
- Do not require a new storage backend.
- Do not replace `stores/audit_store.py` or existing `PipelineStep` / `InteractionResult` fields in this phase.
- Do not turn Monitor into a separate source of truth; it must read runtime projections.
- Do not add contribution ranking, reward, or ceremony behavior for Gift / SC / Guard events.
- Do not introduce a Scenario state machine, Detector / Arbiter architecture, critical hard preemption, FIFO output queue, or output path that bypasses the NEKO Live main chain.

## Reference Principles

NEKO Live may borrow decision-chain principles from the Warthunder reference project, but it must not copy the battle logic or adopt its runtime architecture.

Core rule: 每次猫猫只该说一句；这句话为什么是它，系统必须解释得清楚。

Phase 2B uses three reference principles:

- No FIFO queue: live events are strong real-time input. NEKO Live should not make the cat repeat stale messages from an output queue. Within a selection window, the runtime should keep or select the single event most worth speaking about.
- High-value events may rank higher: SC, Guard, and important gift events may receive higher selection priority than ordinary danmaku. High priority must not bypass Safety Guard, directly call Dispatcher, skip cooldown policy, or ignore `dry_run`.
- `dry_run` must explain the complete chain: even without real output, runtime observability must record whether the event was received, entered Selection, who won, who lost, why candidates lost, whether Pipeline started, whether Safety Guard passed, and whether Dispatcher ended as `dry_run`, `pushed`, or `failed`.

NEKO Live may also borrow the health rows observation model from the Warthunder reference project, but it must not copy Warthunder refresh groups such as `fast`, `map`, `events`, or `mapimg`. Health rows in NEKO Live must describe the NEKO Live main chain: Live Ingest -> EventBus -> Selection -> Pipeline -> Safety Guard -> Dispatcher -> Config Store.

## Implementation Checkpoint

Updated: 2026-07-07

Phase 2C is intentionally paused at a stable backend-observability checkpoint:

- Completed: Dispatcher Outcome standardization distinguishes `dispatcher.dry_run`, `dispatcher.pushed`, `dispatcher.failed`, and `dispatcher.skipped`.
- Completed: Selection Decision Chain records the selected candidate and privacy-safe dropped candidates with skip reasons.
- Completed: Runtime Health Rows are built in `core/runtime_dashboard.py` and exposed from `runtime.dashboard_state()` as `health_rows`.
- Completed: Event-level `trace_id` flows through live payload normalization, `ViewerEvent`, `InteractionResult`, `recent_results`, and `live_explain`.
- Completed: Runtime Timeline Projection is exposed as an in-memory, bounded, privacy-safe projection from `runtime.dashboard_state()["live_explain"]["timeline"]`.
- Completed: Dashboard renders the latest event chain and runtime timeline using the read-only `live_explain` projection.
- Completed: Monitor snapshot emission exposes `latest_trace_id` and compact timeline stage/status/route/reason fields from the same read-only projection.
- Completed: Gift / SC / Guard support events route through `live_support_events`, preserving Pipeline -> Safety Guard -> Dispatcher and privacy-safe support metadata projection.
- Completed: Plugin-owned output policy metadata is emitted with live requests so hosted UI and Monitor can review route, trace, length mode, and response-shape intent without requiring host/core final-output hooks.
- Completed: Plugin-owned prompt material metadata now includes optional meme hints from `data/meme_knowledge.json` and idle host beat material from `data/idle_hosting_beats.json`; Dashboard and Monitor may use fields such as `meme_hint_ids`, `meme_hint_tags`, and `host_beat_*` only as review clues.

Future Runtime Timeline work must continue to use `trace_id`. Runtime Timeline Projection must not be implemented by guessing with UID, event type, or timestamp proximity.

## Canonical Concepts

### Runtime Timeline

Runtime Timeline is the ordered explanation of one event across the runtime. It should be derivable from existing facts such as `LiveEvent`, audit records, `PipelineStep`, `InteractionResult`, and future monitor signals.

Timeline entries should use stable stage names, an outcome, an optional skip reason, and a short privacy-safe message.

Runtime Timeline is a projection of runtime facts. It must not become a second source of truth or a separate event-routing system.

Current implementation status: implemented as a lightweight in-memory projection in `core/runtime_timeline.py`. It records bounded stage summaries keyed by privacy-safe `trace_id`; it does not persist timeline entries or route events.

Final spoken-text replay is not owned by host/core in this phase. The plugin passes `trace_id` and plugin-owned review metadata through output metadata; hosted UI and Monitor may use that opaque metadata plus backend text logs for troubleshooting, but they must not require host/core to shape, suppress, audit, or rewrite NEKO Live speech.

### Runtime Timeline Projection

Runtime Timeline Projection is the privacy-safe view assembled from existing runtime facts for reviewers, monitor views, and Dashboard surfaces.

Projection rules:

- Project from the NEKO Live main chain: EventBus -> Selection -> Pipeline -> Runtime -> Dashboard.
- Include enough information to explain why exactly one event became the spoken candidate.
- Include losing candidates only as redacted candidate metadata, outcome, and skip reason.
- Preserve `dry_run` as a full lifecycle explanation, not as a shortcut around the chain.
- Do not project raw payloads, full prompt text, cookies, tokens, signatures, avatar bytes, or private chat content.
- Store timeline entries in memory only, with bounded retention.

### Stage

Stage is the stable name of a point in the event lifecycle. Stage names are for developers, reviewers, tests, monitor signals, and future Dashboard labels.

Initial stage names:

- `ingest`
- `event_bus`
- `selection`
- `pipeline`
- `safety_guard`
- `dispatcher`
- `config_store`
- `runtime`
- `dashboard`

### Event Outcome

Event Outcome describes what happened at a stage.

Initial outcomes:

- `received`: event entered a stage.
- `published`: event was emitted to the next boundary.
- `selected`: event won a selection window.
- `dropped`: event lost a selection window or was intentionally ignored before pipeline.
- `skipped`: expected guardrail stop; no output should happen.
- `failed`: unexpected error or broken dependency.
- `degraded`: fallback path was used, but the system kept running.
- `pushed`: dispatcher produced real output.
- `dry_run`: dispatcher intentionally did not produce real output.

Use `skipped` for expected policy decisions and `failed` for exceptional behavior.

### Selection Decision Chain

Selection Decision Chain is the ordered explanation of how one candidate wins a selection window and why the other candidates lose.

Rules:

- Selection must choose at most one winner per window for the roast pipeline.
- Selection must not behave like a FIFO queue of stale live events.
- Losing candidates should receive a stable skip reason.
- Priority may influence ranking, but it must remain inside the normal Selection -> Pipeline -> Safety Guard -> Dispatcher path.
- The chain should be compact enough for Dashboard and reviewers to answer: who won, who lost, and why.

### Skip Reason

Skip Reason is a stable key explaining why a stage did not continue toward output. It is not user-facing copy. UI may map it to localized labels later.

Rules:

- Use lowercase dot-separated keys.
- Keep reasons stable once published.
- Prefer specific but reusable reasons.
- Do not include raw payloads, nicknames, cookies, tokens, avatar bytes, or base64.
- If a reason is only meaningful inside one stage, prefix it with that stage or boundary.

Initial skip reasons:

- `input.uid_required`
- `permission.developer_tools_disabled`
- `runtime.disconnected`
- `safety.paused`
- `safety.tripped`
- `safety.queue_limit`
- `safety.rate_limited`
- `viewer.already_roasted`
- `selection.lower_score`
- `selection.lower_priority`
- `selection.low_value_danmaku`
- `selection.quiet_low_priority`
- `selection.window_reset`
- `selection.flush_failed`
- `pipeline.identity_failed`
- `pipeline.request_failed`
- `dispatcher.dry_run`
- `dispatcher.non_deliverable`
- `dispatcher.push_failed`
- `profile.mark_roasted_failed`
- `config.persist_timeout`
- `config.persist_failed`

### Dispatcher Outcome

Dispatcher Outcome is the final output-boundary result for an event that reaches Dispatcher.

Initial dispatcher outcomes:

- `dry_run`: Dispatcher was reached, but real output was intentionally disabled.
- `pushed`: Dispatcher produced real output through the approved output boundary.
- `skipped`: Dispatcher intentionally produced no output for a known policy reason.
- `failed`: Dispatcher attempted the output boundary and hit an unexpected error.

High-value events must still end in one of these outcomes. They must not directly produce output outside Dispatcher.

### High-value Event Priority Contract

High-value Event Priority Contract defines how SC, Guard, and important gift events may influence Selection without bypassing NEKO Live guardrails.

Contract:

- High-value events may receive higher ranking weight than ordinary danmaku.
- Higher priority only affects Selection ranking unless a future design explicitly updates this document.
- Higher priority does not bypass Safety Guard, cooldown policy, `dry_run`, Dispatcher, or privacy rules.
- Higher priority does not create critical hard preemption.
- Higher priority must still produce explainable winner and loser records through the Selection Decision Chain.

### Monitor Signal

Monitor Signal is a stable operational event name or snapshot field that future monitor code may emit or derive. Current reviews derive the same vocabulary from privacy-safe hosted-ui context, recent results, and backend logs.

Initial monitor signals:

- `live.listener_started`
- `live.listener_stopped`
- `live.listener_error`
- `event.received`
- `event.published`
- `event.no_subscriber`
- `event.handler_failed`
- `selection.candidate_buffered`
- `selection.decision_recorded`
- `selection.selected`
- `selection.dropped`
- `selection.flush_failed`
- `pipeline.started`
- `pipeline.skipped`
- `pipeline.failed`
- `pipeline.pushed`
- `safety.paused`
- `safety.resumed`
- `safety.tripped`
- `safety.degraded`
- `dispatcher.dry_run`
- `dispatcher.pushed`
- `dispatcher.failed`
- `runtime.config_changed`
- `runtime.config_persist_timeout`
- `runtime.config_persist_failed`

### Runtime Health Row

Runtime Health Row is the compact status projection for one critical runtime boundary. It answers whether that boundary is still refreshing and where the chain appears to be stuck. It is inspired by Warthunder-style health rows, but NEKO Live defines rows around its own main chain rather than Warthunder polling groups.

Runtime Health Row is not a new execution model, queue, scheduler, or source of truth. It must be derived from existing runtime facts, audit records, interaction results, and future monitor signals.

Current implementation status: backend projection implemented in `core/runtime_dashboard.py`. `runtime.dashboard_state()` exposes the initial rows as `health_rows`, and Dashboard consumes the same facts through `live_explain.chain`, including the latest `trace_id` plus compact timeline stage/status/route/reason fields from the same read-only projection.

Initial health rows:

- `live_ingest`: `last_event_age`
- `event_bus`: `last_publish_age`
- `selection`: `last_decision_age`
- `pipeline`: `last_run_age`
- `safety_guard`: `current_state`, `cooldown_remaining`
- `dispatcher`: `last_outcome_age`
- `config_store`: `last_persist_age`, `last_error`

Initial row fields:

- `id`: stable row id.
- `stage`: matching lifecycle stage when applicable.
- `status`: compact state such as `healthy`, `idle`, `degraded`, `blocked`, or `failed`.
- `count`: optional monotonic count for successful refreshes or observations.
- `age_sec`: optional age since the last successful refresh or relevant observation.
- `last_outcome`: optional latest outcome key.
- `last_skip_reason`: optional latest skip reason key.
- `reply_selection_policy`: optional selection-row debug field derived from `activity_level`; it is not a separate config knob.
- `last_error`: optional redacted error category or reason key.
- `privacy_safe_summary`: optional short redacted summary.

Dashboard and Monitor surfaces may render these rows in any layout, but they must preserve the meaning: each row explains whether one critical NEKO Live boundary is refreshing, stale, blocked, degraded, or failed.

### Dashboard Visibility

Dashboard Visibility defines what the Dashboard must eventually be able to explain, not how it must look.

Dashboard should be able to answer:

- Is NEKO Live listening to a room?
- Is output paused, tripped, degraded, dry-run, or live?
- What was the latest event type and lifecycle stage?
- Why did the latest event not produce output?
- Which event won Selection, and why were other candidates dropped?
- Did Pipeline reach Safety Guard and Dispatcher?
- Did Dispatcher push, dry-run, skip, or fail?
- Is each critical health row refreshing, and which row appears stuck?

Dashboard must not show raw payloads, cookies, tokens, avatar bytes, base64 images, or unredacted private data.

## Event Lifecycle

### ingest

Provider ingest modules such as `bili_live_ingest` and `douyin_live_ingest` receive provider live data and normalize it into `LiveEvent`. Every provider projects the same lifecycle outcomes below, and this stage should explain whether its listener is started, stopped, errored, or receiving events.

Expected outcomes: `received`, `published`, `failed`, `degraded`.

### EventBus

`core/event_bus.py` publishes `LiveEvent` by type to subscribers. This stage should explain whether an event was published, had no subscriber, or hit an isolated handler failure.

Expected outcomes: `published`, `failed`, `dropped`.

### Selection

`modules/live_events` buffers candidates during the cooldown window and selects one event for the roast pipeline. This stage should explain selected candidates, dropped candidates, scoring failures, reset windows, and flush failures.

Selection is not a FIFO queue. It should explain the Selection Decision Chain for the window: the winning candidate, losing candidates, priority or score differences, and stable skip reasons.

Selection may also intentionally skip a low-value danmaku before pipeline after updating room-topic context. This is plugin-owned live behavior, not host/core output suppression. `selection.low_value_danmaku` covers low-information danmaku such as bare reactions or repeated digits; `selection.quiet_low_priority` covers additional plain low-priority danmaku when `activity_level=quiet`. Module status may expose `reply_selection_policy` as a read-only derived policy for Dashboard / Monitor debugging; it must not be treated as a separate user-facing config knob.

Expected outcomes: `selected`, `dropped`, `skipped`, `failed`.

### Pipeline

`core/pipeline.py` handles permission, identity resolution, profile write, once-per-UID gate, request building, safety output gate, dispatcher call, and result recording.

Support events route to `live_support_events` during request building. This route still uses the same pipeline stages and only exposes support summary metadata such as event type, tier, label, gift count, coin total, or guard level.

Expected outcomes: `skipped`, `failed`, `pushed`, `degraded`.

### Safety Guard

`core/safety_guard.py` is the mandatory guard for connection state, pause state, automatic trips, queue limits, and rate limits.

Expected outcomes: `skipped`, `degraded`, `failed`.

### Dispatcher

`adapters/neko_dispatcher.py` is the only output boundary. It must explain whether output was pushed, dry-run, skipped as non-deliverable, degraded to text-only, or failed.

Plugin-owned output-contract helpers are split by concern: `core/live_reply_contract.py` defines structured metadata, `core/live_output_quality.py` owns quality fallback rules, `core/live_output_shape.py` owns final text shaping, `core/live_output_memory.py` owns recent-output negative examples, and `core/live_output_contract_prompt.py` renders prompt-contract text and merges callback metadata. These helpers may shape plugin-owned live output metadata and prompts, but they must not bypass Dispatcher or patch host/core final output paths.

`dry_run` is a Dispatcher Outcome, not an early exit. A `dry_run` event should still explain the earlier lifecycle stages that led to Dispatcher.

Expected outcomes: `pushed`, `dry_run`, `skipped`, `failed`, `degraded`.

### Runtime

`core/runtime.py` owns lifecycle, hosted-ui context, and public runtime API compatibility. It keeps those APIs stable, but delegates mutable runtime cache initialization to `core/runtime_state.py`, module instantiation / ReservedModule registration / pipeline assembly to `core/runtime_modules.py`, and legacy runtime action/helper compatibility to focused `core/runtime_*_api.py` mixins. The implementation owners remain `core/runtime_bili_auth.py`, `core/runtime_config.py`, `core/runtime_live_controls.py`, `core/runtime_instructions.py`, `core/runtime_live_input.py`, `core/runtime_developer_tools.py`, `core/runtime_dashboard.py`, `core/live_hosting_director.py`, and `core/runtime_active_engagement.py`.

Expected outcomes: `received`, `skipped`, `failed`, `degraded`.

### Dashboard

Dashboard consumes the read-only projection from `core/runtime_dashboard.py`; live-state timing helpers live in `core/live_status_timing.py`, idle/active eligibility and Live Director next-action decisions live in `core/live_status_director.py`, and Solo Test Readiness / speech explanation projections live in `core/live_status_readiness.py`. Dashboard should explain the current state and latest event path without becoming the source of truth.

Dashboard should eventually be able to show Runtime Health Rows so operators can distinguish "current config is set" from "each critical boundary is still refreshing".

Expected outcomes: read-only visibility only.

### Prompt Material Metadata

`core/meme_knowledge.py` and `core/live_content_host_catalog.py` are plugin-owned prompt material sources. They may explain why a request carried an optional meme hint or host beat direction, but they are not runtime routes, live-ingest sources, online trend fetchers, or host/core output hooks.

Dashboard and Monitor may surface `meme_hint_ids`, `meme_hint_tags`, `host_beat_key`, `host_beat_shape`, `host_beat_fun_axis`, `host_beat_reply_affordance`, and `host_beat_family` to help reviewers understand live feel, repetition, and handoff material. These fields must remain privacy-safe and compact. They must not be used to infer event identity, force the final spoken text, bypass Safety Guard, or replace `trace_id` timeline reasoning.

## Privacy Rules

- Do not expose raw live payloads in monitor signals or Dashboard state.
- Do not expose cookies, tokens, login credentials, or encrypted credential material.
- Do not expose avatar bytes or base64 data.
- Prefer UID, event type, stage, outcome, reason key, and redacted short messages.
- Audit and monitor data should be enough to debug the lifecycle without reconstructing private chat content.

## Reviewer Checklist

For any future PR touching runtime behavior, event handling, output, monitor, or dashboard visibility, reviewers should check:

- Every new event path has a stage and outcome.
- Expected non-output paths use a stable skip reason.
- Unexpected failures use `failed`, not `skipped`.
- Safety Guard and Dispatcher remain explicit lifecycle stages.
- Dashboard visibility is derived from runtime state, not raw payloads.
- Privacy rules are preserved.
- New reasons or signals are added to this document before use.

## Future Extension Rules

- Gift / SC / Guard handlers must reuse the same stage, outcome, skip reason, and monitor signal language.
- Gift / SC / Guard priority must follow the High-value Event Priority Contract.
- New event types may add skip reasons only when existing reasons are too vague.
- New monitor signals should be stage-prefixed and privacy-safe.
- Runtime Timeline should remain compact enough for a reviewer to inspect in one PR.
- Runtime Timeline Projection must stay keyed by `trace_id`; do not infer event identity only from UID, event type, or timestamp proximity.
- Runtime Health Rows should stay aligned with the NEKO Live main chain and must not copy Warthunder polling group names.
- Dashboard may choose any layout, but it must answer the Dashboard Visibility questions above.
- Future designs must not add FIFO output queues, Scenario state machines, Detector / Arbiter routing, critical hard preemption, or direct output paths that bypass the NEKO Live main chain without a separate architecture review.
